    Later on, I was involved in the hiring process to bring on more developers
    to help maintain all the app platforms (web and mobile apps). I worked in a
    team of 4 to moving forward. I eventually took on the role of Tech Lead and
    was involved with architecting new codebases and mentoring junior
    developers.

        A web app that streams music. I was responsible for the rewriting of the
        entre website. I replaced old JQuery and Handlebars code with a modern
        ES6, React frontend architecture. I also rewrote the server-side Express
        code, replicating all the functionality of the original.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new codebase was significantly more maintainable and easier to add
        functionality to, allowing the company to iterate faster and deliver
        more features to users in less time. Working with a team of one other
        developer and one infrastructure engineer, the new website was
        successfully relaunched and deployed to over 50,000 active users. It
        streamed over 80TB of music a month.
      </p>

      <p>
        The website grew to more than 70,000 active users and 800,000 pageviews
        per month.
